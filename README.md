Biomedical systems which are comprises of differential equations are arduous to explain in block diagrams as a result these are best demonstrated in Laplace transform. This chapter focuses on stability of system's input, output and suchlike entities through Laplace transform as well as inverse Laplace transform.
This renders objectives such as-
•	To generate transfer function.
•	To find the components and step responses of a second order system.
•	To find the steady state errors of a system from transfer function and evaluate coefficients such as Kp, Kv and Ka.
•	To be able to design a PID controller system
•	To calculate the phase of PD compensated system.
